 👋 Hi, I’m Przemo84
 
 👀 I’m interested in web apps. Since autumn 2017 I have collaborated in commercial projects on backend side. I've gained experience mainly in PHP Laravel na Java Spring.
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning on how to handle legacy code. That's why I study Domain Driven Develpment and Design Patterns.
 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a well-coordinated and friendly team that creates fantastic and ambitious solutions.
